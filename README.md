## Graph Database Prototype

Task description:

Goal: To create a backend application using NestJS and GraphDB. Drivine should be used as a database client. Instagram data schema has to be used. Data can be fetched from Instagram web API and persisted in the graph database using Drivine. Endpoints has to be exposed to query any of the available data from the graph database.

Outcome:

A backend app connected to a drivin supported graph database with a query-interface (no fancy UI necessary - plain REST to curl is fine) return some persisted instagram data

Tools which could be helpful:

- Drivine starter repo (Nestjs, Typescript) (https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine-inspiration)

- Open Source Database Schemas (OSDS) Instagram (https://github.com/Vheissu/Open-Source-Database-Schemas/blob/master/vheissu-instagram-schema.md)

- instagram-web-api (https://github.com/jlobos/instagram-web-api) and instagram-private-api (https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api) to get real data from instagram

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

```
